# Take‑Home Assessment

Welcome, candidate! This project contains **intentional issues** that mimic real‑world scenarios.
Your task is to refactor, optimize, and fix these problems.

## Objectives

### 💻 Frontend (React)

1. **Memory Leak**  
   - `Items.js` leaks memory if the component unmounts before fetch completes. Fix it.

2. **Pagination & Search**  
   - Implement paginated list with server‑side search (`q` param). Contribute to both client and server.

3. **Performance**  
   - The list can grow large. Integrate **virtualization** (e.g., `react-window`) to keep UI smooth.

4. **UI/UX Polish(optional)**  
   - Feel free to enhance styling, accessibility, and add loading/skeleton states.

### 🔧 Backend (Node.js)

1. **Refactor blocking I/O**  
   - `src/routes/items.js` uses `fs.readFileSync`. Replace with non‑blocking async operations.

2. **Performance**  
   - `GET /api/stats` recalculates stats on every request. Cache results, watch file changes, or introduce a smarter strategy.

## 🧪 Testing

This project includes comprehensive test suites for both backend and frontend components.

### Backend Tests

**Test Structure:**
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual utility functions (pagination, search)
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete API endpoints and workflows

**Running Tests:**
```bash
cd backend

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run only unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run only integration tests
npm run test:integration
```

### Frontend Tests

**Test Structure:**
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual React components and context
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete user workflows and interactions

**Running Tests:**
```bash
cd frontend

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run only unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run only integration tests
npm run test:integration
```

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Memory leak prevention with AbortController
- ✅ Pagination and search functionality
- ✅ Component rendering and user interactions
- ✅ Error handling and loading states
- ✅ API integration and state management
- ✅ Complete user workflows

## ⏰ Time Expectation

- Estimated time to complete: **1–2 hours**.

## 📤 Submission

Once completed, submit one of the following:

- **short video** recording your work.
- **Github Link** where your assessment result were pushed.

## Quick Start

node version: 18.XX
```bash
nvm install 18
nvm use 18

# Terminal 1
cd backend
npm install
npm start

# Terminal 2
cd frontend
